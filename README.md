# LINUX PROJECT

When we create any project in any software or studio like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), etc. some files and folders also get created inside the project folder.

The basis of this project is that when user/developer gives the name of the project, the project gets created along with required files.

Here, I am taking the example of the framework of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).  Please have a look over them along with the shell script code, required files and code inside them.

## How to view it ?

Have a look at the shell script [AndroidProject.sh](https://github.com/sudhanshu-mallick/LinuxProject/blob/master/AndroidProject.sh) and the produced file hierarchy by it in [Linux App](https://github.com/sudhanshu-mallick/LinuxProject/tree/master/Linux%20App). 

You can execute the shell script in Windows 10 operating system by following the steps mentioned [here](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-sh-or-shell-script-file-in-windows-10). 


## Output On Execution
You will get the following output on execution in your CLI.
